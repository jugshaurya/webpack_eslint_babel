## How you Should be started ?

- download the repo
- add all the code to your repo
- npm i
- Everything Works! 😍

## How I started ?

- \$ git init
- \$ touch .gitignore
- \$ npm init
- \$ npm i `webpack webpack-cli` -D
- \$ inside `package.json` add two scripts:

  - "build": "webpack",
  - "dev": "webpack --mode development"

- now you can build your app using npm run build and get a dist folder
- to run it and see the output run node dist/main.js

- \$ `touch webpack.config.js` file to add more comfiguration to our webpack.

## Notes:

- By default npm scripts watch it out inside node_modules/.bin
- webpack requires a `src folder` to pe present in your project
